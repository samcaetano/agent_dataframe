# agent_dataframe

This is a simple implementation to study the alternative for RAG search, in the context of when we do not have a base of documents to query using RAG strategy.

This is useful when we only have tabular data (TD) available, and translating it to natural language format is unfeasable.

It can be abstracted from using only pd.DataFrames queries to a more complex query in any query language.
